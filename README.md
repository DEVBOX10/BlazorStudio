## Cloning and locally running the repo

- Previous versions of `BlazorStudio` were difficult to clone. I am currently finishing up making the changes so that `BlazorStudio` is 'plug and play' or 'clone and run'. The final change I need to make is publishing the next version of the Blazor.Text.Editor NuGet Package which will be done on `2022-12-23`.
- Until `2022-12-23` BlazorStudio will be referencing a Blazor.Text.Editor NuGet Package version that has not been published yet, I only have it locally on my computer.
