# Documentation

I make videos going through the source code on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzhWhqYVP40as1MFUesQM9w)

As well, there is a README.md for every directory that contains source code. The corresponding README.md goes over the inner workings of the source code located within that same directory.
