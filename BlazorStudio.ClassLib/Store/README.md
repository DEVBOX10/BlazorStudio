# BlazorStudio.ClassLib/Store
This directory contains all non UI C# classes necessary for using the [Fluxor (web link)](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor) library.

As is stated in the [README.md](/BlazorStudio.ClassLib/README.md) for this project:

In [BlazorStudioClassLibExtensions.cs](/BlazorStudio.ClassLib/BlazorStudioClassLibExtensions.cs) are IServiceCollection extension methods to register necessary services. One of those services is [Fluxor (web link)](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor). Fluxor is a .NET implementation of an application architecture pattern named: [Flux (web link)](https://facebook.github.io/flux/). The final comment I'll make on this is that one might recognize the JavaScript implementation of Flux: [Redux (web link)](https://redux.js.org/)
