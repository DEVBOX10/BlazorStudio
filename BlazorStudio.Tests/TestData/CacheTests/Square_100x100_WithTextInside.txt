|		It was a warm and sunny night that morning.                                        |
|       I woke up and looked at my computer.                                               |
|	    Just a text file was open, full screened.										   |
|		The text file read,								                                   |
|		"Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");".                                              |
|		What ever could it mean?											               |
